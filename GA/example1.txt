Create a ROS node in C++ that publishes odometry data for a differential drive robot moving in a circular path.
Write a ROS C++ program that simulates and publishes the motion of a robot around its Instantaneous Center of Rotation (ICR).
Generate a ROS C++ node that calculates and publishes odometry and TF data for a robot moving with constant angular velocity.
Implement a ROS C++ publisher that simulates circular robot motion and broadcasts odometry and transform data.
