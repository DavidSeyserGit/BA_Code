This is the code for my Bachelorthesis about generating ROS source code with Large Language Models.
# Requirements
This code needs a Python Version of at least 3.10
# How to use the script
This script has two parameters that need to be passed via the command line.
    
```
python3 geneticAlgorithm.py -api "your api" -model "your model"
```
